Access Meower from a web browser on many legacy devices without WebSockets
## What do I use?
Try the [API-based](https://meower-everywhere.github.io/Legacy-Devices/api/) client first! If that one doesn't seem to work, then use the [Relay-based](https://github.com/Meower-Everywhere/Legacy-Devices/tree/main/relay) client instead.
