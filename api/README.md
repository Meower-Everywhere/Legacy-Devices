# Legacy Devices
## API
This is the API-based Legacy Devices client. Instead of using your computer as a relay server, this client directly uses the Meower API. This makes it functional without a relay server.

---

The posting feature uses mPost, a service made and hosted by melt. mPost will collect and store your IP address, username, and message content for moderation purposes. Your access to mPost may be terminated at any time for any reason with or without notice. If you do not want this information collected, do not use the posting feature.
